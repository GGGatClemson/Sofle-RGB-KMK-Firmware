# Sofle-RGB-KMK-Firmware
Firmware for the Sofle Rgb V2.1 on KMK

Origial Keyboard Design and Creation : Josef Adamcik

The goal of these files is to allow building a Sofle RGB v2.1 not the keyhive version with a Blok or other RP2040 based controller powered by KMK.
With the advances to QMK supporting the RP2040 contoler and Via this may be unnessisary but using python and easy updates has made this my favorite way to power a keyboard.

Known issues:

The second encoder for the non main side of the split currently doesn't work.

The second OLED for the non main side of the split currently doesn't work.
